                    I'm Janine, currently studying User Experience Design and writing on my bachelor thesis. Besides my student life, I have the opportunity to work at Siemens Healthineers as a UX Designer. I was born in Germany, Bavaria and have been around computers most of my life. After my A-levels, I completed an apprenticeship as an IT Specialist at ProLeit GmbH. Soon I decided to look over my horizon and discovered the Style Guide Concept. I really liked the structured and creative sheet. It turned out to be an important core of the product. One of a lot of reasons is, that the visuals are one of the first impressions a customer can get. That is part of the story, why I found this exciting study subject, User Experience Design. Besides my studies, I gathered a lot of impressions about different working methods in two Start-Ups. When I'm not designing, you can find me bouldering, rock climbing or making photography.
