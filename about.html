                    I'm Janine, currently studing User Experience Design and writing on my bachelor thesis. 
                    Besides my student life I have the opportunity to work at Siemens Healthineers as UX Designer. 
                    I was born in Germany, Bavaria and have been around around computers most of my life. 
                    After my A-levels I completd an apprenticeship as IT Specialist at ProLeit GmbH. Soon
                    I decided to look over my horizon and discoverd the Style Guide Concept. I really liked
                    the structured and creative sheet. It turned out to be an important the core of the product. 
                    One of a lot of reasons is, that the vsuals are one of the first impressions a costumber can get.
                    That is part of the story, why I found this intessting study subject, User Experience Desgin.
                    Besides my studies I gatherd a lot of impressions about different working methods in two Start Ups.
                    When I'm not designing, you can find me bouldering, rock climbing or making photography.
